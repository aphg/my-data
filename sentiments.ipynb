       " 'Being a big fan of Stanley Kubricks Clockwork Orange there was of course no question about it that I had to see this one However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like extremely boring or nothing happened a complete waste of time But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001 A Space Odyssey There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life Of course watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it My god I like my friends a lot but its a pity that I cant share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky That thing my friends is beauty As this film goes to show beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced intellectually shallow consumer driven fastfood western societies That doesnt mean however that I reject these fastpaced societies or that I look down on them and neither does Kubrick but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in And what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming When we go to this place it is possible to get a so called natural high It is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty And never in my life has this natural high or spiritual orgasm as it is called by some or samaddhi by others been more intense Yes its more intense than a regular orgasm several times more intense actually Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right Are they right For me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe In my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter the fourmillion year old black monolith has remained completely inert Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when watching those gorgeous visuals I can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fastfood answers to big ontological questions But instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers The doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame But this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a thing in itself the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating enchanting and maybe even comforting We dont need an answer to whats really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives When we are able to let mystery be what it is to embrace it even we can finally bring our souls to rest I am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us',\n",

       " 'A very early Oliver Stone associateproduced film and one of the first films in the impressive career of Lloyd Kaufman cofounder and president of the worlds only real independent film studio Troma creator of the Toxic Avenger and at the prestigious Amsterdam Fantastic Filmfestival lifetimeachievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years Having raised the money for this film on his own Lloyd wrote this script together with Theodore Gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have Gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself But back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore Indeed it would have been interesting to see Lloyds version of his own script  as one of the worlds most original daring experimental and noncompromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has But as it is we have the Gershunidirected film And weather it is due to the strong script or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own SUGAR COOKIES is a very intelligent highly suspenseful and wellcrafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives The shoestring budget the small studio this was even before Kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now Michael Herz formed Troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive indeed does not have a low budget look at all The story revolves around lesbian Camilla Stone played by enigmatic Mary Woronow and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances I wont reveal not to spoil a delightful story This leads to a succession of plottwists mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by Hitchcocks Vertigo and at least as inventive The atmosphere is a lot grimmer though and some comparisons to Nicholas Roegs and Donald Cammells PERFORMANCE come to mind In this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end which along with a splendidly interwoven subplot with a nod to Kaufmans earlier and unfortunately unavailable BIG GUSS WHATS THE FUSS makes for a very exciting oneandahalfhour Certainly one of the best films in Tromas library and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste The DVD includes some recent interviews Kaufman conducts with Woronov and the other leading lady Lynn Lowry later seen in George Romeros THE CRAZIES thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cultfavorite and a few hints of what would be different had Lloyd directed it himself Highly recommended',\n",

       " 'I hadnt heard of this film until I read an article about it on the Unknown Movies website which made me curious As a cartoonist and illustrator myself Im an admirer of Richard Williamss work  I rate Ziggys Gift as one of the finest Christmas specials of all time and even though Who Framed Roger Rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when I got past the age of sixteen I still have the highest of regard for the amount of work care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals  but it seems the man has his faults most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a supertalented individual like Williams can go given the right circumstancesRaggedy Ann and Andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a childrens cartoon It tries also to be a musical It tries to be a thousand and one other things as well  is it a freakout Is it a mindblower Is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination  until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations Its beautifully animated for the most part though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention but even that doesnt count for much when youre confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the action hereThere are a number of problems with the film but lets start with Raggedy Ann and Andy themselves Theyre the stars of the show yet they have no personalities Actually we get the message that Andy is a wannabe tough guy Im no girls toy he sings and that Ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner a little girl called Marcella carries her upside down but thats all we get to find out about these dullasmud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after I use the word weirdness advisedly because some weird films can be hugely entertaining but this is just flatout strange The toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable but theyre actually bizarre and disturbing The two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this But even theyre relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous French doll Yes this is supposed to be a childrens film Then theres the music none of which is memorable and all of which is sung by actors who cant sing And to add insult to injury theres a lot of singing in this film When Ann and Andy finally make it out of the playroom the first thing they do is sing a LONG number in the woods about how scared they are about how theyll always have each other andyes we get the message This seems to go on forever but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film Not for long though because the Camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like its made from worn and faded denim and  bad enough that hes clearly a paranoid schizophrenic  he also starts hallucinating But this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow The Greedy a living breathing belching farting constantly eating pool of taffy is so trippy creepy and ultimately disturbing youll hardly believe what youre seeing  this is as close to a drugfree psychedelic experience as Ive ever seen on film Then after a long time spent with the Greedy along comes the psychotic Sir Leonard Looney and his master King KooKoo whose throne resembles a urinal I cant believe Im actually writing a capsule description of a real film here  I just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that Im not blogging about an overwhelmingly whackedout nightmare I had Part of the sequence in Looney Land resembles one of the old Winsor McCay  Little Nemo cartoons for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it probably All this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it but there isnt These scenes are just strange and very very long Surrealism only works when theres a strong idea behind it or takes place against some semblance of reality But NOTHING in these scenes points towards any kind of reality Take away this element and youre left with pure self indulgenceAs the final scenes unravel even the animation begins to look less impressive the pirate ship ludicrously detailed jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production and theres a nonevent of an ending that simply suggests money ran out Even at a meagre 86 minutes in length the film feels like a neverending ordeal and its understandable why it flopped on its original release Animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how Williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly but he did and theres nothing anyone can do about it',\n",

       " 'Ive rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it So after 15 minutes of watching Ive noticed that something is wrong with this movie its TERRIBLE I mean in the trailers it looked scary and seriousI think that Eli Roth Mr Director thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid the movie would be funnySo stupid its funny WRONG He should watch and learn from better horrorcomedies such asFright Night The Lost Boys and The Return Of the Living Dead Those are funnyCabin Fever is THE reason why I registered to wwwIMDbcom so I can release my thoughts of discontent about itIve decided to watch the movie a second time AAARGH and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is Resident Evil horror or Dude Wheres My Car comedy I can watch over and over again and still enjoy But thisHow bad can a script and a director be This bad Here are the awful scenes in chronological orderIn the early scenes we see Henry who doesnt realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and deadglazed stare is deadThe movie doesnt explain anything about the blonde longhaired kid who like to bite peopleAnd my answer to Marcys unanswered question Whats wrong with the woods is nothing The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspenseThen the smartest of the 5pack Bert almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire He meets nowinfected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the Fword Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill BertDont make me shoot you he forgets to add with my BB gunBert heads back to the cabin but how about that He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier A moment of clarity for a change Bert doesnt mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gunLater as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire another weirdo shows up with his dog Maybe thats what the warning about the woods is all about Its filled with weirdosand their dogs They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis Their brains are completely intoxicated No wonder why they are all so DUMB This is the last time well see this forgettable characteraliveHenry shows up at their cabin NOTE He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin looking worse almost like a zombie covered in goo He says he needs a doctor But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard seats and windows The Fantastic Five come out running armed with a BB Gun a knife a baseball bat huh Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods a poker and a insecticide spraycan ready to combat the single unarmed and terribly sick man clever script Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth What else am I supposed to do Bert yells in his defense Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the trucks windows instead Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say Hes coming towards us Thanks for the info dumb broads I can see that But I dont think he wants to do you any harm Marcy sprays in his eyes making Henry yelp And our hero Paul touches Henrys arm with a burning log from the campfire which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin Where has all that wisdom gone I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away screamingThe following day Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic And Marcy decides to go for help all by herself in the woods as Paul stays behind with KarenDoesnt that sound idiotic Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already going for helpI skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river How did she get a canoe Does she even know where shes going Anyway she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and like in most horror movies walks inside the cabin sayingHello Is anyone there Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her and me at first And along comes Jeff as well How did THEY get here Did they swim across the river Do you see how brainless the script isDeputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin He somehow doesnt notice the blood on their truck This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out Before I take my own eyes outNow THATs funnyIf you liked this movie do yourself a favor and watch Fright Night The Lost Boys or The Return of The Living Dead Then youll see they are MORE entertaining than thisthing Even the Toxic Avenger part 2 which is also a lousy film is way MORE funnier than Cabin Fever',\n",

       " 'I noted that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath I believe that this diagnosis is manifestly and profoundly incorrectThis is a movie about sadness and about the ability of one particular teenage boy to see sadness in daily life as it lies in wait around every corner in advance of the unfolding of the lives that it impacts A sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others and who while understanding the difference between right and wrong does not care about this difference A sociopath is a subject who places himself or herself at the center of that subjects universe with total disregard for the impact that the subjects actions have for those around him or her One of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy  lacks the ability to feel that which others feel and does not correlate changes in the moods of others as the result of that sociopaths actions with those actions A sociopath CANNOT feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopaths own actions A sociopath is a person who is not completely formed A vital chunk is missing from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath rendering the sociopath immune to talking therapy and other treatment modalities that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings Sociopathy is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the sociopath can do to others Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never raise a blip on the radar of the criminal justice system although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wakesLeland Fitzgerald is no sociopath He is a person who is blessed or cursed with the ability to foresee what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions Leland literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that for want of a better metaphor things fall apart People who fall in love and who kiss and cuddle today turn into pathetic elderly couples The electricity in the eyes of Lelands mother a wealthy New York socialite who loves Leland and who invites him into the home that she shares with her family when he arrives in New York City alone and determined to remain in the city at the age of 12 fades as she explains to him on the last of his visits to New York City that she learned that her husband had been cheating on her all the time that she got a divorce that having ones heart broken happens to everybody and that such loss is an inevitable part of growing up Her eyes still reflect light but the electricity that once illuminated them is gone This scene  this explanation late is it is in coming  is crucial to understanding why Leland commits a seemingly savage senseless crime killing the retarded younger brother of his exgirlfriend Leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy  a lifetime of unattainable goals of being taught only words that signify danger of never knowing the love of another human being of never feeling such love and of never connecting with another person More than any other character in this movie this little boy personifies everything that Leland sees as being inevitable and horrifying about the world Lelands act  killing this little boy  is for Leland an act of mercy committed because this was the one thing that he COULD do in a world in which actions cannot change outcomes Whereas a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes but does not care about the harm inflicted on others by those actions Leland does care What most people view as a barbaric and horrifying act is in Lelands eyes the only decent thing that he can do to alleviate the suffering of just one personIt would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Lelands actions  comforting but incomplete For in the end blame for Lelands actions lies elsewhere As is so often the case there are no easy explanations and no balm to apply to the outraged soul Why did Leland not learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge  that sometimes  just sometimes  people DO remain in love and that relationships DO succeed and that even the saddest lives ARE transformed For Leland there is no middle ground no inner core to which he can retreat and regroup There is only pain and sadness One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father  the brilliant writer played by Kevin Spacey  for not being there at critical times during Lelands development but given this mans thuggish nastiness that may have been a blessingIn the end this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness Why was Leland doomed to view the world through a veil of pessimism and depression There is a maturity to Lelands character  present for example when he repeatedly insists that nobody was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him  that is both stoic and heartbreaking Stoic in that it is absolutely genuine notwithstanding the heated denunciations of Lelands teacher But heartbreaking in that it is born not so much of understanding as of despair Lelands indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the utter certainty of his belief that nothing really matters Nothing that he does can change his fateThis is not sociopathy on display This is if anything its polar opposite',\n",

       " 'I had never heard of Dead Mans Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had Val Kilmer in it in a truly unique role Sadly it wasnt more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions The first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long Its unbelievable how bad it is And sadly it doesnt get any betterVal Kilmer is featured prominently on the movies cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of halfwit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that Ive ever seen in a movie Hes played by Boguslaw Linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his Polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the American old west Does Poland have this type of frontier past I dont know My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point but I can tell you this The Sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember seeing in a movie He is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face Before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose What the hell is this crap I am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie Throughout the movie the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling not\\x85withoutthe law\\x85 You see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie It takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the American southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come fromI have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director Uklanskis minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages Yeah whatever Seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role Personally I would really feel that I had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while I like to think that he didnt even read the script for this mess because if he did I am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the roleAt any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by Kilmer seeking the reward Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic Sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters There is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of American rituals In one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmers eyes for what reason I cant imagine and then later a man makes a short speech over Kilmers corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel What the HELL Not convinced yet Here are some more reasons not to watch it In one scene the Sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick A man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood In a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder Smart Near the end the Sheriff appears to have a broken arm Sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink Also smart Why doesnt he just use his good arm I have no idea That like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever

filmmakers  This movie got made HA',\n",

       " 'Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings In Europe for example weve had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict In the US the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction the US citizen never had to live with its enemy This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign countrys strife But in this movie the director and screenplay did not fall into this clich It turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong its a great story of morality hidden truth and compromise',\n",

       " 'Ill indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin My dissatisfaction is split 30 tonedeafness 70 lackluster writingThe 30 I agree with the first commenters synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories I was surprised how this film at best woefully shortchanges the real NYC by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if its inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl this is coming from someone who likes Gossip Girl A few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by obligation while we can see the gears under the film so clearly striving to be diverse but falling eversoshortThe 70 is why everything falls short All characters white plus a few token minorities are onedimensional cardboard cutouts of people concepts Worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what Id say is a gag we get a basic conceit then some punchline intended to be a clever twist But even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say Okay that was a surprisethe stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow When you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending youre writing jokesSpoilers belowThe movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories Thats fine But romance is amazing deep sometimes complex These romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other Words exchange thoughts are projected through voiceover but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to anotherMeaning there is no seduction in the broad sense no tension and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other The only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy Ethan Hawke gets outwitted by the girl hes hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker Sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as wed be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of A then B So it unfolds if something like a postcard could unfold with all the other tales as well A then BThats It the only point being that these happen to occur on set in Manhattan By the way the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch the only Queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the West VillageIts easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual orientation and so on _New York I Love You_ however deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title We expect to see the real New York and real New Yorkers but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic its characters flown in from The OC plus a few others to make it SEEM as if we are paying attention to diversity But when we look closer at who those characters are the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to representFor example the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact hes the father Notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramaticconstruction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriendstepfather are strutting the girl away it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girls father is Latino ALSO must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer What the dad cant be just some guy from South America Now that hes obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middletoupperclass white woman Are we that naive as to require such As if a Mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatableIts not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone But in every conceivable setup and plot twist the direction taken screams status quo appeals to safety All these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the singledimensionality of the characters inhabiting them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes Asian girl living in Chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy How bout an Asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead Again Im not saying the entire conceit has to be changed Its just that every damn story premise is so hackneyedand thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love New York outside the trite The real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth readingI will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was well dredge and the general feel of many of the scenes The movie was just fine to sit through and I wouldnt dissuade anyone from doing so However it is telling that the most significant homage paid to nonsuperficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased Thats what I love about New York everyones from a different place Well you wouldnt know it from watching this one',\n",

       " 'SPOILERS SPOILERS HERE ON EARTH  2000 12 out of fourMark Piznarskis Here on Earth holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes Literally every contrivance clich and familiar plot element are somewhere in here there is simply nothing unique original or fresh about it God what an agonizing motion picture to sit through I wish I saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my years worst list This is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious and goes downhill from the opening credits and worst of all takes itself seriously Here on Earth is clearly one of the most horrible painful movies to come down the pike in some timeHere on Earth is a teen heartthrob film so it must contain some of Hollywoods most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett fit that vary description and take the lead roles by storm Klein plays Kelley an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father clich number one He is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend Ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father Stuart Wilson This sets up the I dont want your life clich in which the father tries to control his sons life while the son resists rebelliously Throw in Kelleys deceased mother who committed suicide a while back When his father brings home another woman he brutally questions his intentions the no one can replace mom clich counts as number twoJosh Hartnett plays Jasper a character on the opposite side of society to Kelley His family owns a local diner Enter his longtime love interest Samantha Cavanaugh Leelee Sobieski a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene when Jasper and Kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and oh no crashing into the diner causing it to erupt into flames Conflicts between the rich and poor will count as clich number threeThe bungled car chase sets both Kelley and Jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict They get in trouble with the law but because this movie feels the need to exist the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time they must work together to help rebuild the dinerThe two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan Samanthas eye catches Kelley and romantic sparks fly Jasper is jealous but wants what is best for his true love clich number four Her parents Annette OToole and Bruce Greenwood disapprove of her little romantic triangle clich number five but she continues two timing Jasper without a second thought Her father also happens to be the local sheriff how surprising lets count that melodramatic nugget clich number sixThe contrived romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as clich number seven But Samanthas relationship with Jasper is never defined so how can there any romantic tension If the film is going to induce involvement in Samanthas choice between the two young men then we need to see both characters from both sides The movie depicts Jasper as a distraction to her rightful love Kelley Its clear Jasper truly loves her but it is also clear she does not love him back This absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the storyLeelee Sobieski does no harm here however her charm and kind performance do not fit a twotiming character like Samantha John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with Kelley Chris Klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here he spends much of the movie shirtless sweaty and overworked Unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability maybe because he has very little The supporting cast is much more talented Bruce Greenwood supplies the best performance in the film but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments I also enjoyed the performance by Stuart Wilson who perfectly fits the role of a rich controlling father of high social statusThen we lean about Samanthas knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie another spoiler ahead What is this she has a serious incurable illness yet another contrivance into the picture approximately number eight Her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends well at least I think that is what the movie intended to show that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together clich number nineKlein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype but we have seen this so many times before I would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings clich number um was it ten The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and inane a your mom comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment There is a retread from Armageddon as Samantha and Kelley sprawl out in an open field horny as hell as he slowly moves his fingers around her body naming areas after US cities why not call that number eleven The movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension an intoxicated Kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with Samanthas date Jasper but the following day he recites desires only to dance clich number oh no I am losing count',\n",

       " 'Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic The plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game If he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyesThe movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the Titanic which has recently occurred One of the survivors of the Titanic Rose DeWitt Bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic With this the scene shifts to Southhampton Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie On April 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking Also the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle Overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the TitanicMany of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship The core group of Rose Jack Cal and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown Captain Edward Smith the ship designer Thomas Andrew the White Star Line Representative Bruce Ismay and all of the Titanics officers were real The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations In addition Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic Furthermore Mr Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best The richest man on the ship John Jacob Astor who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat In addition Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware The gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912 The rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do The rich did not take well to `new money such as Molly Brown as depicted Everything of the time was very formal Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingA recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise The director James Cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night In addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed However the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterTechnically the film is very well done To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie In addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship Furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmTitanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic Like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you',\n",

and its the tagline which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it There are indeed some things you just dont do with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within My Bosss Daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture My Bosss Daugther is a sordid creepy grotesque experience a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression To see it is to endure it to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself  if any of the cast writers extras Hell even the guys that worked as runners on the set aid in producing anything as Earthshatteringly poor as this again then itll be either because theyve been sent here by the devil Himself to destroy the medium of film or itll be because theyve most probably garnered employment on behalf of the FriedbergSeltzer mobMy Bosss Daugther which Im pretty sure ought to be titled My Boss Daugther grammatically speaking revolves around its hapless male lead named Tom Stansfield Kutcher and a night in at his boss house as he chases that seemingly elusive goal that is his young blonde daughter Lisa Taylor Reid  someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering Chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of Jack Taylor Stamp Tom spies Lisa early on shes taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company After trying to talk to her but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in Toms crotch than anything else he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an afterdark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her  and yes she does still live with her father Think Hitchcocks 1960 film Psycho with the gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughsThe distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which Tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts They are a ruthless and smarmy bunch whom its made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush without ever returning them One day it happens with Tom there and his wish is to return it thus pounding into us that hesnotlikeotherguys This as he first sees Lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position This rather obvious and flatfooted attempt to try and get us to side with Tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these coworkers in this companyIt is however as close as My Bosss Daughter comes to any level of filmmaking From a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from Hell Toms arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party instead he is charged with house sitting Jacks pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house Its been established Terrance Stamps character means business in the strictest of manners firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee Its not that Jack is a shrewed businessman hes a cleanliness freak obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land You can imagine that when were let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong theres obviously going to be troubleThe film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes The first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top you may smirk but by the time half the house is wrecked and Michael Madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug youve got your head in your hands Each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall Inbetween the grossout wackiness the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky saccharine driven romance as Lisa and Tom bond whilst talking of inworkplace and outof workplace personas and that maybe they have more in common than first thought By the hour mark the films opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when theres an entire scene that exists purely to target paraplegics and a dumb subplot to do with a headinjury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded Throughout Stamps character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them to which the commonplace reply ought to be whilst channeling Jack Taylor was reading the screenplay first too complicateda concept for you Stamp',\n",

       " 'After witnessing his wife Linda Hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr Feinstone Corbin Bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patientsThis delightful semioriginal and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties Although The Dentist is intended to be a cheesy fun little film Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense Despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments The Dentist suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicelyCorbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist Dr Alan Feinstone The way Bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous While many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable Had The Dentist not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie Bernsens performance would probably have been much more powerful Sadly the rest of the cast including a prefame Mark Ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flickThe Dentist is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly I would presume for fans of cheesy horror Those who became annoyed at the number of Scream 1996 clones from the late Nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as I did A seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make The Dentist one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990s On top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most gorehounds happy Far from perfect but far from bad as well The Dentist is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once My rating for The Dentist  6510',\n",

       " 'I did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that I have ever seen was of the Heroismbravery and the Honor to have served in Her Majestys ServiceThis film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should behowever I cant say enough for the courage exhibited by SgtCutter in defense of The Uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee groupTo be certain Sgt Cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her Majesty the Queen of EnglandI think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was greatA reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fearI think Grant was excellent in this roletruly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he woreI never felt Ballantine was a shoein in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a pictureWhat do I meanThis picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attentionBoth Ballantine and MaChesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of Her MajestyThese three seem to bring things off rather well and I believe it is a usefuleven enjoyable interlude when Ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it interveneIs it BelievableI dont knowI think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in Tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the Regiments Post when Ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the serviceand getting married and going into the tea businessMaChesney says he could sign up for another 9 yearsIt will make a man out of himI like that sentimentI dont think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interestsWhere does this endin fact it may never endThose interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that I enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps I enjoyed the picture when I was ten years oldI had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when I went into history and found the information about KaliThere is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the Goddess of Kalithis motion picture takes on a quality that I refer to as intelligenceThis is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attemptedI think this is an excellent filmGeorge Stevens directedThere is a few items to be aware of I dont think all the information will jive with history however when the Journalist is addressed as MrKipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is Rudyard KiplingGeorge Stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurredThe information is honestcompelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love Gunga DinThere is in the distance the Black Watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warnedSgtCutter is seriously wounded and Ballantine as well as MaChesney are restrainedDin having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the Colonel of impending perilWith a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time Din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee templeThe sound of Gunga Dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarnedA very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullifiedIt is so Dramatic and tense filled position that as Gunga Din lay Dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now showsSgtCutter says good work soldierI dont know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending perilThe end is far from being anticlimaticit is the telling of who Gunga Din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificedBallantine knows his heart and asks the Colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes MaChesney quite pleased with the Colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate timeThe Colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defenseMaChesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medalThis is a very sober point and then he comes to DinNow here is a man who has no actually status so I am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored deadThe poem is read as though it was just penned by Kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the menGunga Din Bravo',\n",

       " 'I nearly fell asleep during a screening of this Of a boring story that seems to go on forever it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks After a heated affair the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate waysThe male prostitute then goes on a downward selfdestructive spiral trying to find his one true love repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his loveIn the meanwhile he hooks up with one ugly guy who I thought was also a male prostitute a gay basher and some guy who ends up having a threesecond sexual intercourse session with him in a back alleyIt never ceases to amaze me how films STILL portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm All of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them to which he discards their telephone numbersThere is a brief sideplot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle There is also another brief sideplot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window And there is also one more brief sideplot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance but the audience is not advised of his relation to this personNone of these things really connect with each other only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is He seems to be living life like a ghost There was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the worlds saddest song on itOtherwise this movie just seems to go on forever Filmed in black and white it may seem very dreamlike but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmareI found the ending to be confusing as I wasnt quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven That would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe But seeing as this is an independent film movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to use your imagination For those of you who are seeking out nudity there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows In other words dont waste your time with this oneMy Rating  2 out of 10',\n",

       " 'Well maybe the PC version of this game was impressive Maybe I just finished playing the PS2 version and its pretty much a complete messThere are a couple elements that are okay or promising Ill mention those first because it will be over quickly First the idea of a historical GTAlike game is a great one The game Gun was a historical GTAlike game and unlike Mafia Gun was excellent Id love to see a game set during Mafias era done right Next the storyline is well written The story makes sense it has dramatic arcs it uses an unusual device with much of the game being a backstory and its interesting Finally some of the graphicsespecially those used during cutscenesare impressive Mafias designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where GTA skimped on that effort especially the characters Unfortunately in many other areas the graphics kinda stink and Id much rather have excellent gameplay than impressivelooking charactersThe gameplay is what sinks this title so low First off the controls and camera absolutely suck That has to be the first focus of any game developers You cant release a game where the controls andor camera suck Number one theres no reason that the players character Tom cant have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick Unless its absolutely necessary and it hardly ever is I hate the setup where the left stick moves the character in a strafing way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick Here its not only unnecessary it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge For example Tom has to climb on a couple missions But the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera and then press L1 every time you need to climb or Tom will descend insteadNext Ive never seen a worse fighting system The first problem is that you cant autoaim or lock on to any targets At one early point the game seems to tell you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to targets but that never worked So to focus on any enemy you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the characters orientation and the camera which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make Tom disappear all the time By that time youre probably getting pummeled or shot to deathNext if youre touching or almost touching an enemyand thats certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons the fighting systemwhich primarily consists of tapping or holding R1 is completely useless Enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug but you just cant move unless you back off So close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick yelling at the character to move away which it wont do 50 of the time then tapping R1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes R1 useless And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime youre also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything By that time youre probably getting pummeled or shot again and your only option will be to try to move the character away again My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AIs mercy again So much for realistic fightingAnd the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns If youre touching someone half the time the controller just wont allow you to fire off a shot yet they can still riddle you full of holes Additionally theres no autoaim and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive even with the sensitivity set to zero under Options Gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you Luckily or not damage seems to be recorded almost randomly It can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character and theres no rhyme or reason to it You can put five shots into an enemys head and near point blank range and theyll still return fire and hurt you Yet the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system so after shots with powerful enough guns your aim will float off target and youll have to fight with it againAs for the celebrated graphics except for the characters and textures that youre close to theyre actually pretty disappointing The distance always seems mostly empty and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when youre driving The city wasnt very well designed Its not varied enough and there arent many interesting things to see or do The cars seem slow and theyre difficult to control They also all drive about the same Some have mentioned the music but that was also pretty nondescript A much better job could have been done on that end Also as many others have mentioned the load times are ridiculous and constant They tend to be over a minute long and they occur between and in the middle of everythingeven racesOverall the Mafia port to PS2 at least seems to have been very rushed The game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job',\n",

       " 'This is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan whose last film Mayis Sikintisi which was very Cehovian was shown in prestigious film festivals Differing from his previous films the story of Uzak is set on Istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world However in Ceylans film we do see only minor traces of that huge crowd Rather he choose to focus on two characters one photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships The photographer who we understand that has also immigrated to the city seems to be inhabited the customs of the city life not only in material sense In his relation to his relative we see him first as caring and tolerant however when he could not find a job our suburbian character starts to be disturbed for sharing his private space with someone whose leaving date becomes ambiguous I will not reveal the tactics he develops in order to pull his relative out of his life to prevent any harm on your viewing pleasure but it is enough to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics that we acquire within the routine of suburbian life tactics to keep our own private space tactics in order not to communicate with other people tactics to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature since our own experience we believe that is complex enoughCeylans film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the borders of modern or postmodern  city by depicting the two characters in different manners But he doesnt condemn any of the two characters for doing this rather he uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference For example in search of new opportunities we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces Even within the house he prefers balcony as his favourite space On the other hand we see the photographer always within the closed spaces and generally at his home Although there are more than 10 million people out there and lots of adventures lots of interesting things to discover or are there any he prefers sitting at home watching TV etc His home is like his temple a kind of sacred placeEveryone living in a big city and conscious of the experience he is living through will find something belonging to himself in Uzak If you like this film I am sure that you will like Ceylans other two films Mayis Sikintisi The Clouds of May and Kasaba The Town Go and find them',\n",

       " 'As a rule there are few things more dispiriting than Hollywoods attempts to be courageous Mixing caution with heavyhandedness message movies pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems CROSSFIRE is not entirely free from this taint it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious assuming a level of naivity in its audience thats depressing to contemplate As late as 1947 it was a big deal for a movie to announce that antiSemitism existed and that it was bad It was unthinkable of course for Hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was basedits victim was a homosexual Nevertheless thanks to good writing and excellent acting CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crimePostwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir and CROSSFIRE addresses it directly The film is set in Washington DC among soldiers still in uniform but idle spending their days playing poker and barcrawling Joseph Samuels Sam Levene an intelligent and kindly Jew explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive Mitchell who is close to a nervous breakdown the weakwilled Floyd Bowers and Montgomery a tall overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from Tennessee as a stupid hillbilly The three soldiers wind up at Samuels apartment where the drunken Monty becomes increasingly abusive calling his host Jewboy Samuels is beaten to death and Mitchell disappears making himself the prime suspect for the killingUnraveling the crime are Detective Finlay Robert Young dry and bythebook and Sergeant Keeley Robert Mitchum a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell is incapable of murder Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny Gloria Grahame a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him her apartment key and Floyd Steve Brodie who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house While there is no real whodunit suspense the story remains gripping and the trap laid for the killer is extremely cleverThe strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious The cinematography is a striking shadowplay with inky darks and harsh lights rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke Worldweariness is as pervasive as noir lighting Nothing interests me Finlay says quietly To nothing is Ginnys toast in the nightclub Gloria Grahame the paragon of noir femininity nearly steals the movie with her two scenes Platinumblonde jaded and caustic shes the quintessential Bgirl poisoned by the stinking gin mill where she works for laughs she says bitterly her sweet face curdling when Mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife Now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell as when she dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment When he goes there he meets a weasely crumplefaced man Paul Kelly who seems to sponge off Ginny and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions Gloria blows Mitchells goodgirl wife off the screen in a scene where shes asked to give Mitchell an alibi Slim and frail in her bathrobe with her girlish lisp she lets us see just how often Ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a trampRobert Young is a nondescript actor and he stands no chance against Mitchums charisma but he does a good job of keeping his pipesmoking character saddled with delivering the movies earnest message this side of pompousness Mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when hes doing nothing but lounging in a corner you cant take your eyes off him The third Robert Ryan creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable bigot we see his phony geniality his bullying his resentment of anyone with advantages his Am I right or am I right smugness how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising themCROSSFIREs message seems cautious and dated now though not nearly so much as the same years A GENTLEMANS AGREEMENT Finlays speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted next it could be people from Tennessee he says or men who wear striped neckties Or maybe blacks or Japanese or homosexuals or communists The script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems It sweetens its message by making the Jewish victim saintly as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to exonerate the military having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery and stressing that Samuels served honorably in the war Still it did take some guts to depict immediately after World War II an American who might have been happier in the Nazi army and the movies basic premise is still valid If Monty were alive today he would have gone out on September 12 2001 and beat up a Sikh',\n",

       " 'Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky or think hes a tired relic from the 1960s I really had no opinion of the man save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist although I could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings So stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky Rebel Without A Pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 911 I decided to get it just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him While glad I got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so whats all the fuss aboutFor a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the New York Times according to the DVDs case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and I wouldnt even want to watch what a William F Buckley could do to him Granted the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things hed say rather than being on linguistics so maybe thats the reason he came off so badly But again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise\\x85 Even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film this much I knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the Soviet Empire The film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that its difficult to separate all of the jumble His wife Carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film She seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life The lone interesting thing she says is that 911 was a great thing for the Chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since thenNot surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background Its assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one Stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that and slackjawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him This is really poor filmmaking by director and editor Will Pascoe who in the DVDs Filmmaker Statement shows hes yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomskys Other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no boundsGiven that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomskys lectures at McMaster University in Ontario Canada prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era Yes he makes some good points here and there on American media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals As example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled Similarly he claims Trilateralists run the world and that peoples fear of crime is yet another cabals result Of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when Castro and company were great sponsors of it in Latin America Asia and Africa until the Soviet Union fell I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up speciesmixing impregnation centers up in IdahoIn his simpleminded world without grays Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals In short Chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually Near this films end he warns Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didnt like no matter how barbarous their crimes and antiintellectual their posit Please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant DVD',\n",
       " 'Amy Heckerlings second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930s gangster films made in the Warner Brothers tradition Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 Keatons mother Maureen Stapleton has continuing health problems so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle Meanwhile the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin yeah thats right Vermin Griffin Dunne is Keatons younger brother turned district attorney Glynnis OConnor his wife and Marilu Henner plays Keatons moll The film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical filmThe film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour Due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny Piscopo does the once bit one time too many Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito Dom DeLuise Ray Walston as a street vendor Alan Hale Jr as a desk sergeant and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film I think Heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties actual 1939 release date 12 of 4 stars',\n",

       " 'So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into surprise surprise Colombia Not to brag or anything but my father was born and raised in Colombia hence my last name and now hes a doctor in California so no matter what the movies would have you believe there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of ColombiaAt any rate in a drug bust gone bad Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute inspiring him to go to confession somewhere that I have never seen him go before in any of his movies before or since It was actually pretty interesting Seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt whether by a stripper or by a lover never piques the slightest bit of interest from him Hes all getthe badguys all the time But in the confession booth he confesses to having lied sold drugs falsified evidence and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars I hope Im not getting in trouble with God by telling you this\\x85 The priest tells him to go to his family so he decides its time to retire from the force The next third of the movie is an exercise in the paperthin characterization characteristic of Seagals films Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a band of mystic Jamaican drug dealers and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylightHatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach Max a minimal effort by Keith David and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dreadlocked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookwormlooking high school girlsMaybe I just had a sheltered experience in high school but I didnt know crack dealers and crackheads hung out AT SCHOOL in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY At any rate its not long before Hatcher learns how evil these guys are Theyre not just peddling crack to high school kids but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs they engage in smartass staredowns with Max and since thats not enough his 13yearold niece died in their crackhouseAh OK We get the picture Im sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women and maybe steal candy from children too just for good measure Is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are 13yearold niece died in their crackhouse WowAnyway Not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie namecalling where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue but they also dont know how they should act The leader of the drug dealers is named Screwface and I suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is Screwface is a cartoonish Jamaican man with these bright bizarrely green eyes which I am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head His favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown Jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever hes yelling at This guy likes to get so into guys faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses dont touch All I could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breathMan they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican by the way Their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie its nearly impossible to understand them Not that it matters It doesnt matter what theyre saying all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drugrelated thing theyre just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people The movie must have been a huge hit in JamaicaMy biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics particularly of the bad guys as Ive described are spectacularly goofy even for a Seagal film They are so cartoonish and weird that its impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball bmovie creation something slapped together to provide fodder to whom Seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smackdown retribution But there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird For example a mystic I guess you would call her at one point puts some kind of curse on Screwface by if I remember correctly spitting mouthfuls of Bacardi onto a live rooster thats hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of Screwface Hmm Interesting Sadly its this same woman that warns Hatcher that his family has been marked for death by these people meaning theyve got some voodoo hex on them Not to belittle anyone but if I was told that my family had been cursed by people like that I would just laugh at it Hatcher doesnt strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses But the setup as you can see is pretty standard for a Seagal film Unique villains I guess you could say although not very impressive Definitely the weirdest film of Seagals early career\\x85',\n",

       " 'Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is Ponyo a childrens fairytale borrowing on story elements from The Little Mermaid Of course like other Miyazaki classics such as Spirited Away and his last film Howls Moving Castle Ponyo is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a childrens story than those recent efforts Its a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflictPonyo is the story of a bugeyed childishlooking fish of the same name the daughter of an undersea sorcerer who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl When she does she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke In the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm drowns most of the clifftop town where Sosuke lives with his mother and it threatens to end the worldLike Howls Moving Castle Walt Disney picked up Ponyo for an American release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of Western voices even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of Disney band the Jonas Brothers Frankie Jonas and Miley Cyrus younger sister Noah to voice Sosuke and Ponyo respectively Also voicing characters are Liam Neeson Fujimoto Ponyos father Tina Fey Lisa Sosukes mother Matt Damon Sosukes father Cate Blanchett Ponyos sea goddess mother and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by Betty White Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting closeBut voices are of little significance in a Miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity A fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater mustve been a joy for Miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story Among the highlights are droplets of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make Ponyo as awing as any other Miyazaki filmAs a childrens story however Ponyo concentrates its efforts on being adorable The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heartwarming even if Noah Cyrus shouting childishly when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying But as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are theres very little antagonism or danger Past Miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in Ponyo actually shrinks as the story goes along Sosuke believes hes lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea but Ponyo is mostly tension free Most glaringly its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters arePonyo will surely satisfy Miyazakis fans in every way with its imagination and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a childrens movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience Its not quite what youd expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work but its sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviewsblogspotcom',\n",

       " 'A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywoodlike falseness that glorifies things that shouldnt be glorified Im not sure I agree with the filmmakers take on recent events although truthfully I cant always tell exactly where he stands but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across Audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals Most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect Im kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie In fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another Thats not to say that there arent characters real people but except for Jim the protagonist  a kind of 60s drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly A few make a very powerful impression especially a gurulike taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself When he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving Jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment On the cover of the DVD is the quote The danger is clear which is taken from President Bushs speech that paved the way to our incursion into Iraq In retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered',\n",

       " 'ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors Joe Brady Gene Kelly and Clarence DoolittleBrooklyn Frank Sinatra get a special fourday shore leave Eager to get to the girls particularly Joes Lola neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navymad Donald Dean Stockwell and his Aunt Susie Kathryn Grayson Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over Along the way however Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal And does Joe end up with Susie who loves him tooThe first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN the KellySinatra collaboration from 1949 Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structureall the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them Yet both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall Having now seen both films a third time I still stand by that judgement Somehow ON THE TOWN as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter gayer purely and simply happier The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH Im not quite sure why this is The typical argument is that the latter film is overlong at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it However its also a film that grows on youthe more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making And yet something just doesnt hang together quite right It feels almost as if the script was pored over and every single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted and thats exactly what happened No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up and thats probably the films biggest weakness It has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra this really starts to turn one numb after a while Contrast this for example with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN You might well feel that each song each dance cant be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking and thats true But thats also because the writers werent more restrained in adding them in in the first placeAll this long preamble doesnt mean theres nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH The musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra We Hate To Leave I Begged Her and If You Knew Susie the singing of Sinatra What Makes The Sunset The Charm Of You and the best of all I Fall In Love Too Easily and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of Kelly Its also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening Jose Iturbis role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it even Clarences own Brooklyn Pamela Britton is cute and charming as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his and plays the innocent boyman wonderfully a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN His singing is as usual simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing His solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when youve got the voice of a century showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the filmGene Kellys sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kellys film His Joe Brady is a believable real characterhes tough on the outside glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but hes actually the biggest softy on the inside Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands And the dancingagain the film suffers from the too much of a good thing spoils the effect syndrome as it does with Sinatras singing But once again if its Gene Kelly doing the softshoe or tapping across the screen in a sailors outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief might as well err on the side of overdoing it All of Kellys dances are breathtaking be it the pareddown simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to I Begged Her his Mexican Hat Dance with the sweet wideeyed little girl or his lavish Spanishinfluenced dance La Cumparsita Of course the classic image left in audiences minds for all time would be Kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with Jerry Mouse of Tom  Jerry fame A welldeserved golden film memory to be sureits not often that one can say youre impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market But Gene and Jerry still look great with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look It would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself in COVER GIRL and a cartoon animation Its doubtless that this first daring inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs But its also notable for being the first of three KellySinatra film collaborations and though rather too drawnout still a great couple of hours of entertainment Watch it first then again and maybe againitll grow on you before you realise it 7510',\n",

    "2. The graphic representation showed us also that the model had not the best adjustment, and this was because some of the words its showing as the most important ones have no real meaning or sense, and this was because the model was not really the greatest fit.\n",

    "2. La representación gráfica nos muestra a su vez que el modelo no tuvo el mejor ajuste, debido a que algunas de las palabras que menciona como las más importantes en realidad no tienen tanto sentido.\n",
    "3. Se recomienda completar este ejercicio con un modelo de SVM, de Naive Bayes o incluso una clasificación ciega con datos crudos con kmeans para ver el comparativo."
